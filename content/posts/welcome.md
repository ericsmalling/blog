I've been toying with the idea of starting my own blog for many years; even tried my hand at it almost a decade ago but life always seemed to get in the way.

Now that I've entered the last year of by 4th decade on this planet, I've decided that I'm finally going to have a go at this and hopefully can add some value to this little corner of the internet.

So with that, welcome to my blog and I hope you find it worth your time.

Cheers!
